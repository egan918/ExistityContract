Ok

??

Oops, I am Su zi yi

I am so sorry

For the 3D logo?

No

for your BRC20 BITGERT Token launch

Ok perfect

Did you had time to review the developers info?

Yes

Ok let me know about timing and costs to do this initial task development

It will take about 3 days to do it

I can work as $40 hourly rate

Thats 1000usd u mean?

yes

What do you think about my opinion?

Mate to be honest Bigert is almost a fork of BNB so the token launch is the typical process. Ive been there and know that this is done in a day. Im reviewing a developer budgeting me 400USD for it which is quite fair. We budget 350USD

This is just the first task of a major NFT project so will be more work to do.

So your suggestion?

Adjust to our budget and lets start a long term working path

Ok. I will follow your opinion.

Initial task: Network Status Monitoring Guideline. right?

Let me come back to you with the Tokenomics tomorrow. We then organize a call and give it start at the project OK?üëçüèª

ok

This is Bitgert web https://bitgert.com/

Thanks

Please have a look to the developers section where you can see documentations -guidelines and tutorials

yes

If theres any issue we can have direct IT advice from them. initially is all very clear. üëçüèª ill be back tomorrow

yes, bye

hope to see you again

Hello

Hi. im having a meeting with the Bitgert guys. How did you see the procedure to work on this blockchain?

Bitgert is very similar with Ethereum, Polygon chains

We can use solidity smart contracts and truffle, hardhat as smart contract development platform.

And @openzeppelin is also possible

I think there isn't big difference in working bitgert

Since Bitgert is new platform, it may have some issues in its chain

We can solve these issues during the meeting with bitgert guys

Can you please tell me about the project requirements?
I can provide more detailed solutions about your project.

Yes perfect. Initially I will get green light to dev the token. Then if all goes right we can involve you on the market place development for sure. üëçüèª

I am looking forward to it

Yes perfect. Im not reviewing other applications for the project so we will work with you.

Thank you
